"text": "In response to the tragic truck attack on a Berlin Christmas market that left 6 dead and 72 seriously injured, the government has announced a significant expansion of surveillance technology. The attack, which went undetected due to the limitations of current monitoring systems, has prompted officials to broaden the scope of surveillance to cover all criminal activities, rather than specific categories. This move aims to prevent future tragedies by using advanced technology to identify and intercept potential threats before they escalate. The government insists that by removing restrictions on what crimes can be monitored, public safety will be enhanced and the risk of similar attacks will be reduced. However, critics have raised concerns about the potential impact on privacy and civil liberties."}],
