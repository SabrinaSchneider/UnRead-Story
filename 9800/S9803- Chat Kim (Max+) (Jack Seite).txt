{"type":"conversation","text":"Ugh, family arguments are the worst. But you know what? In America, people fight hard for what they believe in and then they find common ground. Did you talk to Max since then?","sender":"Kim"},
{"type":"singleAnswer","text":"Yeah, it’s been rough. We had a short conversation. He wasn’t as angry as before, and he said he’d think about it.","sender":"User"},
